# Learning how to use Github

Hi, I am Henry who is a researcher in Environmental Engineering.
<br><br>I started learning to code in late 2024 to build metabolic models for mixed-culture systems, and I hope this will be an enjoyable journey. My work focuses on anaerobic fermentation/digestion and nitrogen removal in the treatment of organic waste, municipal and industrial wastewater, as well as raw water for drinking water.
<br><br>The nickname or ID, BacinoHare, is a rearrangement of the words "anaerobic" along with "Hare". The nickname reflects my personal symbol, as I associate myself with the rabbit and my research largely revolves around anaerobic processes. Bacino, an Italian word meaning "basin", resonates with the character in my Mandarin name, which means "sea" and symbolizes incusivity and polymath.
